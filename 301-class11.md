# EJS
- EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- install express with npm `npm install ejs`

1. ## Create the partials
- You can use EJS to include repeatable parts of our site (partials/reused code) and pass data to our views.
1. ## Add the EJS partials to views
  - Use `<%- include('RELATIVE/PATH/TO/FILE') %>` to embed an EJS partial in another file.
    - The hyphen `<%-` instead of just `<%` to tell EJS to render raw HTML.
    - The path to the partial is relative to the current file.    
1. ## Pass data to views and partials
- To echo a single variable, we just use `<%= tagline %>`.
