# Reading - Custom Hooks

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?

A component is created (mounted), updated, and then "dies" (unmounting).
1. Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect

`useCallback` will help in avoiding regeneration of functions when the functional component re-renders.
1. Why are functional components preferred over class components?

They are easier to read and test. 
1. What is wrong with the following code?

You cannot access "event" inside of a stateful setter (in this case, `setCount`). It is a synthetic event. Instead, on the line above setCount, you could do something like `const {value} = e.target` and then feed `value` in to `setCount`.
````
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }

  let renderedItems = []

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    useEffect( () => {
      console.log('component mount/update');
    }, [count]);

    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
  }

  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}
```` 
## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
1. state hook- lets you add React state to function components
1. effect hook- lets you perform side effects in function components
1. reducer hook- accepts a reducer function with the application initial state, returns the current application state, then dispatches a function.
