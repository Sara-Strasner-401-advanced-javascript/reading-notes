## [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
Common mistakes when pair-programming in an interview setting
- Trying to start writing code as soon as possible. You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it.
- Another big mistake is trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration.  Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

### A simple set of steps
1. Read the problem completely twice.
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
1. Optimize the manual steps.
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
1. Optimize the real code.
***As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.***

Many times you will find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated. In those instances, you will want to try and find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process above for each half. This method of tackling a problem is called “divide and conquer” and is quite effective.

Value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do - and the less trivial and mindless tasks you’ll get caught in.
Extremely successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction. They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.

In his landmark book ***Deep Work***, Cal Newport recounts some choice insights on how to develop insanely productive results through removing all distraction and entering flow states:
> “Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”

So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?
Here are the steps:
1. Understand
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step). How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.
1. Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!
1. Divide
Pay attention. This is the most important step of all. Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry. Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve. Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer). Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
1. Stuck?
First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair. Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!
Here are three things to try when facing a whammy:
- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

## [The 5 Whys: Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)
You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

How to use the 5 Whys:
1. Assemble a Team
Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.
1. Define the Problem
If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures."
Then, write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"
1. Ask the First "Why?"
Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?")
Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened. This prevents 5 Whys from becoming just a process of deductive reasoning, which can generate a large number of possible causes and, sometimes, create more confusion as you chase down hypothetical problems.

Your team members may come up with one obvious reason why, or several plausible ones. Record their answers as succinct phrases, rather than as single words or lengthy statements, and write them below (or beside) your problem statement. For example, saying "volume of calls is too high" is better than a vague "overloaded."

1. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

Tip:
Try to move quickly from one question to the next, so that you have the full picture before you jump to any conclusions.

1. Know When to Stop
You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident. (As we said earlier, if you're not sure that you've uncovered the real root cause, consider using a more in-depth problem-solving technique like Cause and Effect Analysis , Root Cause Analysis , or FMEA .)

If you identified more than one reason in Step 3, repeat this process for each of the different branches of your analysis until you reach a root cause for each one.

Tip 1:
The "5" in 5 Whys is really just a "rule of thumb ." In some cases, you may need to ask "Why?" a few more times before you get to the root of the problem.

In other cases, you may reach this point before you ask your fifth "Why?" If you do, make sure that you haven't stopped too soon, and that you're not simply accepting "knee-jerk" responses.

The important point is to stop asking "Why?" when you stop producing useful responses.

Tip 2:
As you work through your chain of questions, you may find that someone has failed to take a necessary action. The great thing about 5 Whys is that it prompts you to go further than just assigning blame, and to ask why that happened. This often points to organizational issues or areas where processes need to be improved.

1. Address the Root Cause(s)
Now that you've identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.

1. Monitor Your Measures
Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
