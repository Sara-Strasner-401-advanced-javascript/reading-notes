# Socket.io

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

Packets let the networks be connectionless (no prearranged session needs to be established before one end can transmit to another). [Source](https://kb.iu.edu/d/anyq)
1. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionlsess protocol. Why is this?

It doesn't need to establish a connection before sending data. 
1. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

Yes.
1. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

No. You cannot reconnect an existing socket once you've tried to connect it, even if the connect attempt failed. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48181014/can-i-use-the-same-socket-for-multiple-connections)

1. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

Yes.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
1. Observer Pattern- where an object maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
1. Listener- "listens" for some sort of state change, then performs a given function
1. Event Handler- responsed to a given event (a button click, for example), then excecutes code
1. Event Driven Programming - the flow of a program is determined by events (by clients, other servers, etc.)
1. Event Loop- looks at the stack and at the task queue. If the stack is empty, it takes the first thing on the queue and pushes it onto the stack.
1. Event Queue- where asychronous code waits to be run
1. Call Stack- essentially a "to-do" list of functions written in code, which is excecuted in order
1. Emit/Raise/Trigger- causes a function to be excuted
1. Subscribe- attaching a socket to a given channel 
1. database- essentially a filing system
