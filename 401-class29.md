# Readings: Routing

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?
Yes, via `this.props`
1. When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
It renders based on the state that is given to it from the parent. 
```
<Main>
  <Content />
</Main>
``` 
1. Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
Yes.

by using a spread operator

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
