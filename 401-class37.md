# Readings: Redux - Combined Reducers

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?

There are lots of differing opinions on this one. I think Redux is better suited for larger scale apps. 
1. What is the purpose of a reducer?

It maintains your state, including setting an initial state. 
1. What does an action contain?

A payload, which can be used to run some sort of function. 
1. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?

To keep the data in the store unchanged. 

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

action creator- 
reducer- a fil that creates change in a store
dispatch- a method on a redux store that is "dispatched" to various components
