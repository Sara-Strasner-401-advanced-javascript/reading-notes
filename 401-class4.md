# Data Modeling

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

  - Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code.
  - You receive fast feedback.
  - You spend less time debugging.

 from [Benefits of Test-Driven Development](https://dzone.com/articles/20-benefits-of-test-driven-development)
1. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

You can use beforeEach and afterEach if you have some code you need to run repeatedly (like clering a database) for many tests.
from [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/setup-teardown)

1. What is one downside of Test Driven Development

It takes a lot of time and effort that can feel tedious and delays the writing of usable code. 
1. Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

The inheritance is different. Classes can extend other classes, creating a parent/child relationship.


1. Why REST?

It makes it easier for computer systems to communicate with each other. It is also stateless. 

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- functional programming-  Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. Data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions [from my 301 Reading Notes](301-class9.md)
- object-oriented programming (OOP) The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Data is stored in objects. from [How to explain object-oriented programming concepts to a 6-year-old](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/)
- class-  a template for creating objects
- super- calls the constructor of the super (parent) clas
- this- refers to the object being created in a constructor function
- Test Driven Development (TDD)- writing tests before writing code
- Jest- a JS testing suite
- Continuous Integration (CI)- integrating code (presumably from different developers) contintuously throughout the development process
- REST- Representational State Transfer. An architectural style that makes it easier for computer systems to communicate with each other. 
- Data Model- organizes data and standardizes how the data elements relate to one another from [What is a Data Model?](https://cedar.princeton.edu/understanding-data/what-data-model)

## Preview
1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
ES6 Classes, REST, and CI
1. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
Data Model, Jest, and what ***exactly*** functional programming is
1. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
I've heard data modeling is a really useful thing to know, and a big part of our whiteboard exams.
