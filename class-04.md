# Links
- Links are created using the `<a>` element.
- The `<a>` element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLS.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to. 

# Layout
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box. Block level elements start on a new line. Inline elements flow in between surrounding text. If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element. 


# Functions, Methods, and Objects
Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code. Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform a specific task. Objects are used to create models of the world using data. Objects are made up of properties and methods.
