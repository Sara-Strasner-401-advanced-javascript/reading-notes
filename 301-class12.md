# EJS Partials
- EJS partials can be used when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views, like in a nav bar or footer.
- You define that reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.

## How To
1. In the views/partials/ directory create your partials file. For example navbar.ejs and footer.ejs. 
1. Including a partial in EJS is quite straightforward. You use `<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>` where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
  - The `<%- %>` tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the `include()` statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’, etc…
