# Reading: Context API

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()

- `useMemo()`will recompute memoized value only if one of the dependencies has changed.
- `useReducer()` is similar to useState() but works better for complex state logic or if the new state depends on the previous state
1. Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

so React can distinguish them and ensure they are following the applicable rules
1. What do custom hooks usually do?

1. Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications

1. Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

the state would be the returned data, the state setter would set that data, and the setter would be wrapped in a function that makes the API call
