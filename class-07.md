# Tables
The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page. A table is drawn out row by row, using the `<tr>` element for each row. Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the `<td>` element. Use `<th>` for table headers.

You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes. For long tables, you can split the table into a `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.

# Functions, Methods, and Objects
Functions let you group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value. 

An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. JavaScript has several built-in objects such as `String` `Number` `Math` and `Date`. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 

Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
