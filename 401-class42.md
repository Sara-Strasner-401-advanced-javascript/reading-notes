A lot of hesitation toward self-driving cars revolves around the "hackability" of this technology. Could hackers break into the code of these cars and wreak havoc? Experts note that self-driving cars will be particularly susceptible to hackers becuase they will need some sort of interface to connect to the outside world. 

I definitely agree with these concerns. Lots of technology is very hackable, and self-driving cars would be an irresistible target to many hackers.

According to this article from 2018, Google employees were angry that the company was making a censored search engine. Employees felt that they did not have the information required to make ethically-informed decisions about their work or their employment at Google. Adding complication to this issue is the fact that this decision was likely financially motivated: China has the largest number of internet users in the world which has an extremely high potential for profit. I agree with the employees' concerns. Companies should give their employees the information they need in order to make ethically-informed decisions about their jobs. The fact that Google kept this a secret, to me, implies that they knew it was wrong and that there would be outcry.
