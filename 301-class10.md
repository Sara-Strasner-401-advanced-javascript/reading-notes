# The Call Stack 
A **call stack** is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.


The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

## What causes a stack overflow?
A **stack overflow** occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

## The key takeaways from the call stack are:
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
1. Code execution is synchronous.
1. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
1. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.

# [Error Messages and Debugging](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)
- **Reference errors** This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
- **Syntax errors** This occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.
- **Range errors** Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.
- **Type errors** Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
