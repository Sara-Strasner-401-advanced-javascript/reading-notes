# Event Driven Architecture

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but also support ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers. 
1. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
store the messages in a queue
1. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming? I searched high and low for the answer for this and could not find it. 
1. How do you test an event driven system? 
by emitting different enents.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
1. FIFO Queue - first in, first out. How you add and remove things from queues
