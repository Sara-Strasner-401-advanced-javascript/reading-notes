# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### Key Terms
- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed. Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. 
- Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. Popping an empty stack will result in an exception. Popping a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. 
- Top - This is the "top" or beginning of the stack.
- Peek - Peeking shows the value of the top Node in the stack. Peeking an empty stack will result in an exception. Is an O(1) operation. 
- IsEmpty - returns true for an empty stack; an O(1) operation. 

- Stacks follow the FILO (first in, last out) concept: The first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
- Stacks follow hte LIFO (last in, first out) concept: the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## Queues

### Key Terms
- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. Dequeuing an empty que will throw and exception.
- Front - the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear - the rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek - shows the value of the front Node in the queue. Peeking an empty queue will raise an exception.
- IsEmpty - returns true on an empty queue.

- Queues follow the FIFO (first in, first out) concept: the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.
- Queues follow the LILO (last in, last out) concept: the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
