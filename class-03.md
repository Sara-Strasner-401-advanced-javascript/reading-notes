# Lists
There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition. 
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another. 

# Boxes
CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box. You can control the borders, margins, and padding for each box with CSS. You can even hide elements using the display and visibility properties. 

Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and vice versa. 

# Arrays in JavaScript
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't store just one value; it stores a list of values. Consider using an array when working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other. The values do not need to be the same data type. The values are accessed as if they are in a numbered list (which starts at zero, not one). 

# Decisions and Loops
The if ... else statement checks a condition. If it resolves to true the first code block is executed. If the condition resolves to false the second code block is run instead. 

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if that variable matches that value. 

## Loops
Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops.
1. **For.** If you need to run a code a specific number of times, use a for loop. It is the most common loop.
1. **While.** If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop. Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the cone will contine to loop as long as the condition is true. 
1. **Do while.** This loop is very similar to the While loop, but it has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.
