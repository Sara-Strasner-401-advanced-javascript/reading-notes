# Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees

## Terms
Node - the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
Root - the first/top Node in the tree
Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
Edge - the link between a parent and child node
Leaf - a node that does not contain any children
Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Traversal
There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:
- Depth First- where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.
  - Here are three methods for depth first traversal:
    - Pre-order: root >> left >> right
    - In-order: left >> root >> right
    - Post-order: left >> right >> root


- Breadth First- iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. Traditionally, breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree.

## Binary Trees
Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children). There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows. Searching a BST can be done quickly, because all you do is compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree. If the value is smaller, you only traverse the left side. If the value is larger, you only traverse the right side.
