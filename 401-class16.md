# Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Why is access control important?

It protects your data from unauthorized users. It also protects users from being able to access data they are not equipped to handle. 
1. Describe an application that would need access control.

A database containing medical information. Nurses would need different access from a billing department, for example. 
1. What is a role used for?

For defining the access that users have different resources within a given application. 
1. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

You just have to made edits to the roles, and not to individual users, reducing the amount of work needed to maintain access control.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
1. Authorization - you are allowed access based on who you are
1. Role Based Access Control - users are assigned to different roles, which have different access
1. Capabilities - what a given user is authorized to do within a given app. For example, editors might have update capabilities. 

## Preview
1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
authentication vs. authorization, encryption, and frontend event listeners
1. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
I've never heard of event-driven programming before. I also want to learn more about the Main Loop, and Event Emitters.
1. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
a backend event listener
