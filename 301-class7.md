## REST
The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. 

- REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
- URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.
- Verbs are important. There's a powerful concept in programming and CS theory called “polymorphism”. That's a geeky way of saying that different nouns can have the same verb applied to them. 
- HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page.


## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
Five years ago, Google became focused on building the perfect team. Google’s People Operations department had already scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical).

### Key Findings
- On effective teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking."
- Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. 
- There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. 

**Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work. Physiological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.**
