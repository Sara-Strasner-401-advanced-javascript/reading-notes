# Audio, Video, Images

## Images
You can specify the size of images using CSS. This is very helpful when using the same sized images on several pages of your site. You can also use CSS to align images both vertically and horizontally. You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page. Background images can appear once or be repeated across the background of the box. You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image. To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites. When a single image is used for several different parts of an interface, it is known as a sprite. By default, images are inline elements. 

## Practical Information
 - Search engine optimization helps visitors find your site when using search engines. SEO is often split into two areas: on-page techniques and off-page techniques. 
 - Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there. 
 - To publish your site on the web, you will need a domain name and web hosting. 
 - FTP (File Transfer Protocil) programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
 - Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce, and other popular website tools (so you don't have to write them from scratch). 

 ## Video and Audio APIs
HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents — `<video>` and `<audio>` — which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback, seeking, etc. One very important attribute is `<video controls>`, which enables the default set of playback controls. If you don't specify this, you get no playback controls.

In HTML5, the HTMLMediaElement API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players — for example `HTMLMediaElement.play()`, `HTMLMediaElement.pause()`, etc. This interface is available to both <audio> and <video> elements. See [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Video_and_audio_APIs) for more information.
