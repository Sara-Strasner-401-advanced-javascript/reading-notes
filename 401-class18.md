# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue? 

Standard queues deliver each message at least once. FIFO queues deliver a message exactly once, and it remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it. Duplicates are not introduced into the queue.

1. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

The client acknowledges receipt of the message. 
1. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

I'm still stumped by this one. I tried Googling it to no avail. I also don't remember it from lecture. 

1. How do you test an event driven system?

By emitting different enents to check that the system is responding properly.
