# Sending Form Data
What happens when a user submits a form â€” where does the data go, and how do we handle it when it gets there?

- An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server.

## On the Client Side
The `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are `action` and `method`.
- The `action` attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. 
- The `method` attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the `GET` method and the `POST` method.

## On the Server Side 
Whichever HTTP method you choose, the server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs.
