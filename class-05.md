# Images
The `<img>` element is used to add images to a web page. You must always specify an src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of the image. You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format. 

Photographs are best saves as JPGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs. Measure images in pixels. 

HTML5 has introduced a new `<figure>` element to contain images and their caption so the two are associated. 


# Color
Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reaction. There are three ways to specify color in CSS: RBG values, hex codes, and color names. 

Color pickers can help you find the color you want. [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) is a great resource. 

It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content). 

CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as *RGBA.* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA. 


# Text
There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing. There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed. If you want to use a wider range of typefaces, there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them. You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
