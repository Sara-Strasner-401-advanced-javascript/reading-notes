# Express REST API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
1. True or false: The route handler is middleware?
1. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
1. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
1. What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

- Middleware - like signposts along the way for the train track of the request object
- Request Object - The Request object is used to get information.
- Response Object - an object or information/data that is sent in response to a request object
- Application Middleware - I read this [Express documenation](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.application) and I'm still not sure what application middleware is.  
- Routing Middleware - Same as above. I read the [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)and I'm still a little unclear. 
- Test Driven Development- writing tests before writing code, and then writing code specifically designed to pass the given tests
- Behavioral Testing - a software testing method in which the internal structure, design, and implementation of the software being tested is not known to the tester. [source](https://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/black-box-testing/)
