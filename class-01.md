# Structuring Web Pages with HTML

## Process and Design
- Be sure you have a clear understanding of who your audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they are looking for, and when they are likely to return to your site.
- Utilize **site maps** to plan the structure of your website. 
- **Wireframes** let you organize the information that will go on each page of your site. 
- **Visual Hierarchy** allows your audience to understand what you are trying to tell them. 
- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. 
- Use groupings and similarity to help simplify the information you present. 

## Structuring Web Pages with HTML
- HTML uses **tags** (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning. 
    - Tags are often referred to as elements.
    - Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
    - Opening tags can carry **attributes**, which tell us more about the content of that element.
        - Attributes require a name and a value. 

## ID and Class Attribites
the id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements. However, an id tag can be used to identify **one** element. Class tags can be used to identify more than one element. These attributes are used by CSS and Js to perform a certain task. 

## HTML5
- The new HTML5 elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple `<div>` elements)
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements. In this case, extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google. 

## JavaScript
A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow to achieve a goal. It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extenstion. The HTML `<script>` element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (like how the `<link>` element can be used to load a CSS file).
