# CSS Animations and Teambuilding

## CSS Animations
- The `transform` property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.
- With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted. There are four transition related properties in total, including `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, and `transition-delay`.

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
Five years ago, Google became focused on building the perfect team. Google’s People Operations department had already scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together (the most productive employees tend to build larger networks by rotating dining companions) to which traits the best managers share (unsurprisingly, good communication and avoiding micromanaging is critical).

### Key Findings
- On effective teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking."
- Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. 
- There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. 

**Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work. Physiological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.**
