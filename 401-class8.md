# Access Control (ACL)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
The Basic authentication scheme uses a username and a secret. The Bearer authentication scheme uses a token. from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34013299/web-api-authentication-basic-vs-bearer#:~:text=2%20Answers&text=The%20Basic%20and%20Digest%20authentication,is%20described%20by%20the%20RFC6750.)

1. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
securely transmits information between parties as a JSON object
1. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
There are lots of considerations around creating and stiring secrets, but the two major considerations are cybersecurity and efficiency of creation/management/revocation.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- encryption -converting information or data into a secure code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
- token- used to authenticate requests to APIs
- bearer- The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request
- secret- digital authentication credentials
- JSON Web Token-  compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. from [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/json-web-tokens)
