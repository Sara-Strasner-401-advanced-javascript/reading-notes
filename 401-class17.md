# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue? 

Standard queues deliver each message at least once. FIFO queues deliver a message exactly once, and it remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it. Duplicates are not introduced into the queue.

1. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

The client acknowledges receipt of the message. 
1. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

I'm still stumped by this one. I tried Googling it to no avail. I also don't remember it from lecture. 

1. How do you test an event driven system?

By emitting different enents to check that the system is responding properly. 

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- Server Instances- When you launch a Server, an Instance will be launched in the specified cloud infrastructure
- Containers- provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object.
- Cloud Services- services that do not rely on internal infrastructure or hardware.
- Cloud Architecture- components and subcomponents required for cloud computing
- AWS- Amazon Web Services (provides cloud computing and APIs)
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku- EC2=Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud; Beanstalk=AWS Elastic Beanstalk. All are cloud services that let us deploy, monitor, and scale web and mobile apps.
