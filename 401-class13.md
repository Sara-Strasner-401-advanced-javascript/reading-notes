## Review, Research, and Discussion
1. What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful? 

HTTP relies on a req and res cycle. In contrast, sockets do not require a request in order to send a response, enabling real-time updates.. 
1. Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?

Yes. Even when websockets can be used, the initial connection setup it done over HTTP. Also, a socket.io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can serve its own client code through /socket.io/socket.io.js.

1. What happens when a client emits an event?
That event is handled by the server. 

1. What happens when a server emits an event?


1. What happens if a client “misses” an event? How can we mitigate this?


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
1. Socket - an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network.
1. Web Socket - a protocol, for communicating over a single TCP connection
1. Socket.io - a node library that enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication [Source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/index.htm)
1. Client - the end user
1. Server - connects a client to online resources, like databases or other servers
1. OSI Model - creates standard communication protocols. contains 7 layers
1. TCP Model - a concise version of the OSI model
1. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol. contains 4 layers
1. UDP -  (User Datagram Protocol) sspeeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party.
1. Packets - Packets of data let the networks be connectionless (no prearranged session needs to be established before one end can transmit to another). [Source](https://kb.iu.edu/d/anyq)
