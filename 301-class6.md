# Node.js
- Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.
- Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week. 
- You install (via npm) and run (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.
- Node.js lets us run JavaScript on the srver.

## What is Node.js suited for?
- building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration
-  building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database), or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded. 

## Advantages of Node.js
- speed and scalability
- You can do everything in the same language. For example, you can easily share code between the server and the client.
- Another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON.
- With a background in JS, transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages.
